few_shot_cot_prompt="""In these examples, you are given a task description and an input. Break the input down into subtasks in order to solve the task. You can use arithmetic and algebra functions in one or more of your substeps.
Description: Solve the following arithmetic problems on ratios and fractions, , writing out intermediate arithmetic calculations as needed.
Input: Divide the number 49 into two parts, such that if the greater part is increased by 6 and the lesser part is decreased by 11, their ratio is 9 to 2. What is the greater number?
    choice: 29 
    choice: 30 
    choice: 31 
    choice: 32 
    choice: None
Q1: [algebra] Let the greater part be x. What is the lesser part?
#1: 49-x
Q2: [algebra] What is the greater part if increased by 6
#2: x+6
Q2: [algebra] What is the lesser part if decreased by 11
#2: 49-x-11
Q3: [algebra] What is the ratio of greater to lesser after the change?
#3: (x+6):(49-x-11)
Q4: [algebra] Write down the equation to solve for x
#4: (x+6):(49-x-11) = 9:2
Q5: [solve] Solve for x: (x+6):(49-x-11) = 9:2
#5: x = 30
Q6: [compare] Which option is closes to this answer?
#6: 30

Description: Solve the following arithmetic word problems, writing out intermediate arithmetic calculations as needed.
Input: A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
Q1: What is total number of toys that need to be made?
#1: 400
Q2: How many workers in total?
#2: 5
Q3: [arithmetic] How many toys do 2 of the workers produce?
#3: 2 workers working for 10 hours making 6 toys per hour produce 2*10*6 = 120 toys.
Q4: [arithmetic] How many toys do another 2 of workers produce?
#4: 2 workers working for 10 hours making 4 toys per hour produce 2*10*4 = 80 toys.
Q5: [arithmetic] How many toys did the last worker make?
#5: Out of 400 toys, 120+80=200 toys were made by the first 4 workers. The 5th worker didn't finish the job, since 20 toys were still remaining to be made. So they made 400-200-20=180 toys.
Q6: [arithmetic] How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce if he worked for 10 hours?
#6: The 5th worker made 180/10 = 18 toys per hour.
